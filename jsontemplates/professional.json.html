    <h1>Tamar.com Ltd. <small>(full- &amp; part-time, August '05 to August '10)</small></h1>
    <h2>A leading website design and search engine optimisation agency</h2>
    <h3>Web developer</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <p>I have developed and maintained commercial websites for Tamar's clients for five years, as both a full-time employee and a part-time contractor.</p>
  <p>I collaborated with Perl and .Net developers and the design team on both small and large projects, producing and improving programming solutions for online insurance and loan quote engines <small>(e.g. endsleigh.co.uk)</small> and e-commerce sites <small>(e.g. dreams.co.uk)</small> for many clients. I integrated and maintained server- and client-side solutions, usually performing multiple tasks simultaneously and responding to tight deadlines.</p>
  <p>Having a lead role in the client-side development project for the re-design of bennetts.co.uk, I was solely responsible for designing the templating structure and CSS code, as well as coordinating development. I was also the lead developer for Tamar's then largest and most complex JavaScript project: creating a new student insurance quote engine for Endsleigh <small>(endsleigh.co.uk/student-possessions.html)</small>. I created Tamar's proprietary libraries and integrated them with jQuery.</p>
  <p>I worked briefly as the project manager for Tamar's experience design team in 2006 and again in 2007. I responded to clients' calls and emails and scheduled tasks throughout the team under time pressure.</p>
