<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I have been developing commercial search-engine optimised websites for over 5 years, with experience of the entire application development life-cycle. I follow trends in internet development closely and have extensive experience of cutting-edge server- and client-side technologies including object-oriented PHP MVC frameworks, semantic HTML5, CSS3 and webservers as well as UNIX and Windows server maintenance and technical support. I have communicated and consulted with clients regarding online marketing strategy, user experience decisions and maintenance requests.</p>
<p>My recently completed MSc focused on usability analysis techniques and user-centred systems design principles with an emphasis on the design of mobile- and PC-based interfaces for online applications. Following on from this, I am particularly interested in developing my skills in usability analysis, user-interface design and user experience development.</p>
