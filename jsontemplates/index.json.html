I follow trends in internet development closely and have extensive experience of cutting-edge server- and client-side technologies including object-oriented PHP MVC frameworks, semantic HTML5, CSS3 and webservers as well as UNIX and Windows server maintenance and technical support. I have communicated and consulted with clients regarding online marketing strategy, user experience decisions and maintenance requests.</p>
