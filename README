This repository contains all the view files for my website.

On my server these files are located in /var/www/robinwinslow.co.uk.

The repository currently contains all the client-side resources (images, css, js) as well as json-template files.

No client-side code is contained in this folder. The idea is that the templates will be parsed with a controller (in any language that can parse json-template files) located elsewhere.

Examples of such controllers (ones for node.js and PHP written so far) are contained in my "web-controllers" repository:
