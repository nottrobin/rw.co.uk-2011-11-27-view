      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi. My name's Robin Winslow, and this will be my home page.</p>
      <p>
        It will contain information about me and my interests - and my blog - 
        as well as information on my academic and professional credentials, 
        examples of my web development work and little programs and scripts I've 
        experimented with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this site is still in its planning stage and probably won't 
        be done before the beginning of 2010 - please do check back then if 
        you're interested :).
      </p>

      <article>
        <h1>Big improvements</h1>
        <p>Wow it's been almost a year! How embarassing!</p>
        <p>Though I'm still just playing around with my site, lots had happened in the last week or two:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/">Apache2</a> has been completely removed in favour of <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> - which appears to perform faster with lower memory footprint.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> has been completely removed in favour of <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> - once again SQLite is simpler with lower memory footprint.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>This page is now running as a <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> application, which should hopefully enable me to rapidly be adding bits of functionality henceforth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>This page is now written in (I think) valid <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">XHTML <strong>5</strong></a> - which isn't actually properly supported by a single browser yet, but that's okay because it's impressively backward-compatible.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pretty exciting stuff. At leasy for me.</p>
        <p>Look for more updates soon, I hope.</p>

        <h1>New host!</h1>
        <p>
          Not much has happened to help the website. Still. But I have switched host. I am now hosted by <a href="http://tsohost.co.uk/">TSO host</a>.
          And I'm well impressed. They are not only good value for money (the
          best in the UK), they also have fantastic customer support, their
          servers run impressively fast, and everything is done in the simplest
          most intuitive way.
        </p>
        <p>I think I'm in love.</p>
        <p>If you or anyone you know are thinking of switching host I would seriously recommend checking out these guys.</p>

        <h1>Cefalonia</h1>
        <p>In Cefalonia, in Greece, and it's hot. And finding internet is a challenge, and I haven't got any further with the website :(.</p>
        <p>I've decided to work on my CV first, and get that up here, and then I'll work on the website design.</p>

        <h1>Going on holiday</h1>
        <p>I'm just about to leave on holiday for three and a half weeks, but I'm taking a lot of reading with me, as well as my laptop.</p>
        <p>Hopefully by the time I get back I will have got a lot further with the planning.</p>
